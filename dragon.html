                <h3>No game is complete without a dragon</h3>
                <p>That includes Fruitimon. Enter: Dragon Fruit, a fierce apex predator who won't hesitate to incinerate any intruders into its orchard lair. Dragon Fruit is obstensibly the King of Fruitimon, his reign unquestioned.</p>
                <h3>Hot topic</h3>
                <p>Fruitimon fans have been wanting a dragon since before Fruitimon even released; in fact, Fruitimon as of this date hasn't released yet! Fruitimon - Phase One is scheduled for release on September 7th, 2022. When it finally comes out, dragon hunters will be able to find Dragon Fruit rooming in the <a href="fruitBasket.html">Fruit Basket</a>, where Fruitimon of all kinds can sometimes be spotted, if one is lucky enough to catch them checked into that hotel-style home.</p>
                <h3>Apex predator</h3>
                <p>While Dragon Fruit might be the mightiest of the Fruitimon, he's certainly not the only one. Check out the Fruit Basket to learn about more amazing Fruitimon, and keep checking back here in <a href="news.html">News</a> for more Featured Fruits articles.</p>
