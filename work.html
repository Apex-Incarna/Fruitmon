            <h3>It's almost here!</h3>
            <p>Fruitimon Phase One is almost ready to launch! However, there are still quite a few things that need to
                be fixed before Fruitimon can actually launch. </p>
            <h3>Work in progress</h3>
            <p>Fruitimon is undoubtably a work in progress, and that means that there are going to be a few weeds in the
                garden before everything ripens. Here's a list of some of the things that are planned for Fruitimon
                Phase One, but aren't currently active:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A dedicated News page</li>
                <li>A decided-on homepage</li>
                <li>A shop</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <h3>Deadline</h3>
            <p>Fruitimon Phase One is scheduled to launch on September 7th, just a few short days from now. That means
                that everything on the previous list (and even a few more suprises) have to be completed before then.
                It's a tall order, but we here at Fruitimon love a challenge.</p>
