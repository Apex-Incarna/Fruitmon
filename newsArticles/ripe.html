                <h3>It's finally here!</h3>
                <p>Hooray! It sure took a while, but Fruitimon Phase One is finally ripe, and ready to be harvested! Read on to discover everything that Phase One has to offer, as well as a couple teasers for what may be coming in the future!</p>
                <h3>What we've got</h3>
                <p>Fruitimon Phase One is far from everything Fruitimon can be, but as a completely original game with no inspirational material anywhere, it can be hard to come up with (let alone create) Fruitimon's full potential. Until then, though, enjoy all of the fun features of Fruitimon - Phase One:
                    <ul>
                        <li>A full website</li>
                        <li>A How-to-Play page</li>
                        <li><a href="/fruitBasket.html#fruitBasketAbout">The Fruit Basket</a></li>
                        <li>News articles (like this one!)</li>
                        <li>A shop</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>What we havn't got</h3>
                <p>We here at Fruitimon will be the first to admit that the game isn't where it could be. It still lacks a few things, such as:
                    <p><b>Stock</b> - Spoiler alert! Fruitimon has nothing to sell you! If you hadn't figured it out already, trying to buy anything from the shop will only make you end up on a page with a sad-looking fruit grocer telling you that we're all out of stock. Fruitimon doesn't have the bugget right now to be a business, so things like toys, merchandise, or even the game itself are currently unavailable for purchase. Maybe one day Fruitimon can upgrade from a meme to a money-maker, but until then, enjoy drooling over all of the amazing products that may never be in the <a href="/shop.html">Shop</a>.</p>
                    <p><b>The Game Itself</b> - Quite an oversight when you think about it, Fruitimon as a totally original card game currently doesn't exist. Since you can't buy the game from the shop, there's no way to actually play it. Until that day when the money rolls in, the closest you'll get to playing Fruitimon is some knockoff game.</p>
                    <p><b>An Adaptive Website</b> - While the website is indeed "full" in that it has everything on it that a website should, there's not really much here that you, the viewer can do to reach us here at Fruitimon. As it stands, the Fruitimon website remains a <em>static</em> webpage, meaning that the website sever can speak to the viewer's browser, but the browser can't speak back to the server. This eliminates features such as creating and logging into an account, which would definitely be a necessary part of Fruitimon - Phase Two.</p>
                </p>
                <h3>What next?</h3>
                <p>Enjoy Fruitimon in all of its current, Phase One glory. And who knows? Maybe some magnanimous user tracks us down at Fruitimon and provides a generous donation to get the website going. Maybe that magnanimous donor could be you...</p>
